"""Pure python bindings for the augeas library

Augeas is a library for programmatically editing configuration files.
Augeas parses configuration files into a tree structure, which it exposes
through its public API. Changes made through the API are written back to
the initially read files.

The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file
format and the transformation into a tree.
